        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>My name is Lai Minh Tri, but if you have difficulties pronouncing it, you may call me Jay, you may reach me
           by email at Laiminhtri22082003@gmail.com. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, and I've been living in
           my house in District 7 since 2017. Aside from my native language, I am fluent in English and Japanese.
           In my spare time, I'd like to spend time with my friends, particularly to play games or watch movies and
           spend quality time together. My pastime has been traveling and playing basketball since I was a youngster,
           and it would be good to have some pals to do it with.</p>

        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <p>I have always thought that a day with only 24 hours is never enough for a person to have time for their
           family and career, which is when IT comes to mind. IT has such an impact on our everyday lives that
           I remember watching a YouTube video when I was younger about a man attempting to automate every fundamental
           task in his life. At the time, I had decided to pursue a career as an IT developer.
           I want to enjoy my life to the fullest, and that can only happen if everything I despise becomes an
           IT developer in the future.</p>
